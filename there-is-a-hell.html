      <p>There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret. (sometimes abbreviated to There Is a Hell...) is the third studio album by British rock band Bring Me the Horizon. It was released on 4 October 2010 by Visible Noise. The album was produced by Fredrik Nordstr√∂m and Henrick Udd at IF Studios in Gothenburg, Sweden, with additional work at Sunset Lodge Studios in Los Angeles, California. It features guest vocals from Canadian singer Lights, Josh Franceschi from British rock band You Me at Six, and Josh Scogin from American bands The Chariot and '68.</p>
      <p>The album was recorded between March and June 2010. It expands on the band's previous material, drawing from the metalcore genre and incorporating a wide variety of experimentation, symphonic, and electronic influences, clean vocals, and choral vocal samples. The band described Oliver Sykes' lyric writing as "personal" and "darker and moodier than music on the previous albums". The title is taken from the opening track, which is repeated multiple times throughout the song.</p>
      <p>There Is a Hell... received mostly favourable reviews from music critics, who praised the album's musicianship, lyrical content, experimentation, and maturity compared with the band's previous material. It is the only Bring Me the Horizon album with rhythm guitarist Jona Weinhofen before his departure in January 2013. The album charted in several countries, including Canada, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, and topped the charts in Australia. Two tracks were released as singles and five as music videos; "It Never Ends" charted on the UK Rock Chart, the UK Independent Chart and the UK Singles Chart.</p>
